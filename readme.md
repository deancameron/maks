This is the readme for expenser.

I'd written something like this in straight php... badly... a couple years ago. My day jobs have distracted me from doing fun stuff, though getting better at javascript was "fun" and learning jQuery was and jQuery Mobile is very fun...

Enough complaining.

This is a basic thing for me and the bride to enter expenses daily. We can keep track of our spending and, most importantly, keep track of shit for the IRS.

I was tutored on this by max surgury, a young genius. https://github.com/msurguy/

Definitely worth the $50/hr to answer my stupid questions and help me out when I got stuck.

Hire that kid... he's a go-getter.
